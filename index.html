		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Logan Davoll is from <strong>Lyons Ohio</strong>, but it wasn't always like this. Before he turned 5
		years old he moved from Zone after Walgreens decided to offer to buy his family's property.
		His parents accepted the offer due to the money slump they were in. It was quite a lot of money
		at that time, it equaled around 5 weeks of pay from his dad's job. So with a curious mind and a
		head bursting with imagination, he set out with his family to house hunt. Fast forward 13 years
		and you get a very creative, rescourful, kind, and hardworking boy that does what he can to make
		his day as fun, <em>in his opinion</em>, as possible.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Family</h2>
		<p>Logan has 4 siblings which may not sound like a lot, but when they're all together it can
		get a bit crowded. In fact, 3 of them already moved out already, making more room in his home than
		ever. It is sad that he won't have that many people around anymore but he'll push through, he
		always does. But one things for sure, it will definitly be quieter around the house from now on.
		Logan has 2 sisters and 2 brothers, <em>"-Perfectly balanced, as all things should be."</em>
		Though he only has his little brother left. His big brother, <strong>Ian</strong>, and bigger sister,
		<strong>Haylee</strong>, moved out together because they got along so well, and his younger but
		still older sister, <strong>Alexandra</strong> or <strong>Zannie</strong> for short, is
		currently moving out. He also has 3 pets. 2 dogs, <strong>Suzy</strong> and <strong>Bella</strong>,
		and 1 duck, <em>Button</em>. Button is mainly his pet because he raised him since he was a duckling.</p>

		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>Logan has a very active imagination, so naturally, he uses it daily to make his life a little
		more interesting. He has created many different things using just his imagination, and thought his
		solutions to some problems may seem weird, <strong>most of the time</strong> they get the job done.
		He loves to play video games, <strong>obviously</strong>, and is quietly cometitive about such things.
		He also likes to laugh a lot. To learn a little more about him, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"

		<h2>Other</h2>
		<p>About his imagination and the things it creates. It's created fantasy worlds galore, some small,
		some overflowing with lore and backstory. He creates charaters for evryone close to him, so they can
		live in his made up world. His character is a giant floating skeleton head with six arms. He also
		is trying to create his very own video game. His favorite character that he's created is A-002, a
		a robot from "Botco." that lost control and started making hostile robots to kill any living entities.
