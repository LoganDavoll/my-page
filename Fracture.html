			<p>A-002: The second model of the "A" style of robots. Created to make slaves to mankind, it
			ran off the beaten path and went rouge creating hostile henchmen to protect its one and only
			home, the factory it was made in.</p>

			<p>A defense robot made by A-002 to keep intruders away from its chambers. These big brutes
			are made of heavy metal and are very strong. They are able to pull their arms, legs, and head
			into their body in order to roll like wrecking balls. They can extend their arms up to 3
			times their original length.</p>
